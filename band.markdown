*Bang Frame album cover.*

**_Bang Frame_** — released December 13th, 2025, is an EP from Luke about escaping the simulation. Isn't that cool?

*The Diary / Journal of Deranged Psychopaths album cover.*

**_The Diary / Journal of Deranged Psychopaths,_** — released September 8th / 7th / 13th, 2025, depending on who you ask — is Another Banger's fourth home studio album. It tells the story of two musicians who lose their minds with jealousy after their old mates' band blows up, leading them to commit horrible atrocities in the name of "justice."

*11:30 Burrito album cover. — Fun fact about this album cover, it won first place in an art contest. Don't ask me how.*

*$5 Egg album cover.*

**_11:30 Burrito,_** & **_$5 Egg,_** — released May 5th, 2025 — are dual EPs released at the same time, each written by Luke and Matt respectively. They tell no story and are not related to the other releases at all. They're still really good, and you need to listen to them to enjoy anything else made by anyone else.

![I don't even care album art](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2738c8a5cfc765e9101447f4e48)
*I Don't Even Care album cover.*

**_I Don't Even Care,_** — released September 24th, 2024 — is Another Banger's third home studio album. *(The same joke twice in a row. It's a metaphor for the two of us. It was a smash hit! (Lie).)* This album tells the story of a man named Jason who loses his marbles and burns down his and his wife's home. Pretty gnarly.
