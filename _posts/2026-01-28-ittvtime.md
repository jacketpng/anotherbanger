# <span class="wave" style="font-family: 'Anton', 'Impact', serif;">IT'S T! V! TIME!!!</span>

Listen to my new cover of It's Tv Time from Deltarune Chapter 3 RIGHT FREAKING NOW!!!!

I've only posted two other covers but I put the most work into this one by far! I am very quite proud of it.

[Here's a link](https://www.williamkage.com/snes_soundfonts/#tit_soundfont) to the soundfont I used for the orchestral hit. It's the same one as in the original. Also thanks to a random reddit user that I can't find anymore for sharing it.

Happy listening!!!
